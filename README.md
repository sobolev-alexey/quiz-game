# Quiz Game challenge

This project is built with TypeScript using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), and [Ant Components Library](https://ant.design/components/overview/).

10 random questions are loaded every time you start the game, varying in difficulty levels.

The difficulty level can be adjusted from the dropdown on the top right of the screen.

Your score, list of the questions, correct answer and answer time duration will be shown at the end and you can share your results with  friends.
